title: Component shortcodes
---

You can embed React, Vue, Svelte, and more into your existing templates. Let's learn how!

## Prerequisites

{% include 'prereqs.md' %}

## Basic usage

Using the `component` [shortcode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/), you can insert components into any static template that 11ty supports.

First, ensure your component is **located in your includes directory.** This defaults to `_includes` for new 11ty projects, but you can [override this from your eleventy config](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#directory-for-includes).

For instance, say you've written a Vue component under `_includes/Component.vue`. You can insert this component into your Nunjucks and Liquid templates like so:

```html
{% raw %}{% island 'Component.vue' %}{% endisland %}{% endraw %}
```

> These examples work from markdown (`.md`) and HTML (`.html`) files as well! You can use liquid syntax within either of these by default, though we recommend using Nunjucks instead. See [our recommend config options](/docs/config/#recommended-config-options) for more.

This will do a few things:

1. Find `_islands/Component.vue`. Note that 1) we'll always look inside the `_islands` directory to find your components, and 2) the file extension is _required_ (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.svelte`, etc).

2. [Prerender](https://jamstack.org/glossary/pre-render/) your component at build time. This means you'll always see your component, even when disabling JS in your browser ([try it!](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/disable/)).

One feature we _won't_ provide automatically: hydrating on the client. In other words, your React `useState`, Vue `refs`, or Svelte stores won't work immediately. You'll need to opt-in to sending JavaScript to the browser, which brings us to our next section...

## Choose how and when to hydrate

Slinkity requires a special `hydrate` or `renderWithoutSSR` prop to ship JavaScript alongside your components. This lets you use your favorite component framework for templating guilt-free, and opt-in to JS bundles when the need arises.

To hydrate that `Component.vue` from earlier, you can apply the `'client:load'` flag:

{% include 'examples/hydrate-component-shortcodes.md' %}

For a full list of options to fine-tune how and when JavaScript is loaded on the client...

## Pass props to shortcodes

You can also pass data to your components as key / value pairs.

Let's say you have a date component written in your favorite framework (`_includes/Date.jsx|vue|svelte`) that wants to use [11ty's supplied `date` object](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-eleventy-supplied/). You can pass this "date" prop like so:

```html
{% raw %}{% island 'Date.jsx|vue|svelte', 'client:load' %}
  {% prop 'date', page.date %}
{% endisland %}{% endraw %}
```

You can access either of this prop inside your component like any other prop:

{% island 'Tabs.svelte', 'client:load' %}
{% prop 'id', 'prereqs' %}
{% prop 'tabs', ["React", "Vue", "Svelte"] %}
{% renderTemplate "md" %}
<section>

```jsx
export default function ViewDate({ date }) {
  return (
    <time datetime={date}>{date}</time>
  )
}
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
<template>
  <time :datetime="date">{{ date }}</time>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ["date"],
}
</script>
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
<script>
  export let date = '';
</script>

<time datetime={date}>{date}</time>
```
</section>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
{% endisland %}

### Pass multiple props

You're free to pass as many key / value pairs as you want. The names and ordering of your keys shouldn't matter, since they're all crunched into a single "props" object for your component.

{% island 'Tabs.svelte', 'client:load' %}
{% prop 'id', 'shortcode-multiple-props' %}
{% prop 'store', 'templates' %}
{% prop 'tabs', ['nunjucks', 'liquid'] %}

{% renderTemplate 'md' %}
<section>

```html
{% island 'Apropcalypse.jsx|vue|svelte', date=page.date,
url=page.url, 'client:load', fileSlug=page.fileSlug %}
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
{% island 'Apropcalypse.jsx|vue|svelte' 'date' page.date
'url' page.url 'hydrate' true 'fileSlug' page.fileSlug %}
```
</section>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
{% endisland %}

> Is that a "hydrate" flag sandwiched between the other props? Yep! Do we care? Nope.

## Pass children / unnamed slots to component

We have a separate [paired shortcode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/#paired-shortcodes) for passing child HTML: `slottedComponent`. 

Say you have a simple component to wrap text with a dropdown toggle. That component could be written like so:

{% island 'Tabs.svelte', 'client:load' %}
{% prop 'id', 'prereqs' %}
{% prop 'tabs', ["React", "Vue", "Svelte"] %}
{% renderTemplate "md" %}
<section>

```jsx
export default function Dropdown({ heading, children }) {
  return (
    <details>
      <summary>{heading}</summary>
      {children}
    </details>
  )
}
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
<template>
  <details>
    <summary>{{ heading }}</summary>
    <slot />
  </details>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ["heading"],
};
</script>
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
<script>
  export let heading = "";
</script>

<details>
  <summary>{heading}</summary>
  <slot />
</details>
```
</section>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
{% endisland %}

You can use this component the same way as the `component` shortcode, now with children:

{% island 'Tabs.svelte', 'client:load' %}
{% prop 'id', 'slotted-shortcode-usage' %}
{% prop 'store', 'templates' %}
{% prop 'tabs', ['nunjucks', 'liquid'] %}

{% renderTemplate 'md' %}
<section>

```html
{% island 'Dropdown.jsx|vue|svelte', heading='Full disclosure' %}
<p>"details" and "summary" are kinda confusing element names</p>
{% endisland %}
```
</section>
<section hidden>

```html
{% island 'Dropdown.jsx|vue|svelte' 'heading' 'Full disclosure' %}
<p>"details" and "summary" are kinda confusing element names</p>
{% endisland %}
```
</section>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
{% endisland %}

### Important gotcha: templating in children

You may be rushing to try slotted components in your markdown:

```md{% raw %}
{% island 'FancyBackground.jsx|vue|svelte' %}
### Why I love markdown

- Bulleted lists are easy
- Paragraph and code blocks are even easier

{% endisland %}{% endraw %}
```

ðŸš¨ **Careful, this won't work as written!** Paired shortcode content is processed as plain HTML, so markdown syntax won't work as expected ðŸ˜¢

But all is not lost. Since you _can_ still nest other shortcodes as paired shortcode content, you can use [11ty's handy `renderTemplate`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/render/) like so:

```md{% raw %}
{% island 'FancyBackground.jsx|vue|svelte' %}
{% renderTemplate 'md' %}
### Why I love markdown

- Bulleted lists are easy
- Paragraph and code blocks are even easier

{% endrenderTemplate %}
{% endisland %}{% endraw %}
```

> Be sure to set up `renderTemplate` in your 11ty config before trying this. [See their docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/render/) for more.

This will process your markdown, then pass the result to your component.

So injecting components into templates is nice... but what if we want to build the entire route using a component framework?
