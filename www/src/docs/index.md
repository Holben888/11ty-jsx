## Technologies used

Slinkity stands on the shoulders of giants. You can think of Slinkity as the "glue" binding 2 tools together:

1. [**Eleventy:**](https://www.11ty.dev) a static site generator with a rich feature set for fetching data, composing layouts, and inserting content with "shortcodes."
2. [**Vite:**](https://vitejs.dev) a bundler that takes the boilerplate out of your set up. It'll compile JS component frameworks, handle CSS preprocessors with little-to-no config (say, SCSS and PostCSS), and show dev changes on-the-fly using [hot module replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

| PostCSS config (ex. Tailwind)                                                         | {% featureProgress '‚úÖ' %} |
| CSS imports via ESM (including CSS modules) *                                         | {% featureProgress '‚è∫' %} |
| Plugin ecosystem for your favorite component framework<br />(Vue, Svelte, Solid, etc) | {% featureProgress '‚è≥' %} |
| Eleventy serverless compatibility                                                     | {% featureProgress '‚ùå' %} |
| Shared state between component shortcodes                                             | {% featureProgress '‚ùå' %} |
| Styled components & Emotion                                                           | {% featureProgress '‚ùå' %} |

_*CSS imports will work today, but with one caveat: stylesheets will bleed to other routes on your site. We're actively working on a fix!_

- ‚úÖ = Ready to use
- ‚è∫ = Partial support
- ‚è≥ = In progress
- ‚ùå = Not started, but on roadmap
