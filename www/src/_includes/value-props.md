Slinkity is the simplest way to handle styles and component frameworks on your 11ty site. Once installed, this:

- ðŸš€ **Unlocks component frameworks** like React for writing page templates and layout templates. Turn an existing `.html` or `.liquid` file into a `.jsx` file, and you're off to the componentized races.
- ðŸ”– **Includes powerful shortcodes** to insert components into existing pages. Add a line like this to your markdown, HTML, Nunjucks, etc, and watch the magic happen: {% raw %}`{% react 'path/to/component' %}`{% endraw %}
- ðŸ’§ **Hydrates these components** when and how you want. Use component frameworks as a static template to start, and opt-in to shipping JS as needed with our [partial hydration helpers](/docs/partial-hydration).
- ðŸ’… **Bundles all your resources** with the power of Vite. Use your favorite CSS preprocessor, JS minifier, and more with minimal config.
