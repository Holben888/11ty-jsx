Finalize API for Slinkity 1.0. This comes with a number of improvements, including:

- A new `{% island %}` shortcode with reimagined methods for hydration and prop passing
- Bump to Vite 3.0 ðŸš€
- A new `island` export for component pages to better separate hydration from your frontmatter
- Removing old APIs, including the Slinkity CLI
