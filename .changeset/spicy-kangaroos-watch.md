"create-slinkity": patch
---

Fix missing pieces of the 1.0 canary refactor:

- Fix `ReactDemo` reference on preact page
- Fix unused `hydrate` prop across Slinky components
- Add `sass` as a dependency. This is no longer bundled with Slinkity.
- Move `hydrate` flags to `island` export across pages
