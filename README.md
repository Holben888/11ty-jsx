# Slinkity

> 🚧 **This project is heavily under construction!** 🚧 As excited as you may be, we don't recommend this early alpha for production use. Still, give it a try if you want to have some fun and don't mind [logging bugs](https://github.com/slinkity/slinkity/issues) along the way :)

Slinkity is the simplest way to handle styles and component frameworks on your 11ty site. Once installed, this:

- 🚀 **Unlocks component frameworks** like React for writing page templates and layout templates. Turn an existing `.html` or `.liquid` file into a `.jsx` file, and you're off to the componentized races.
- 🔖 **Includes powerful shortcodes** to insert components into existing pages. Add a line like this to your markdown, HTML, Nunjucks, etc, and watch the magic happen: `{% react 'path/to/component' %}`
- 💧 **Hydrates these components** when and how you want. Use component frameworks as a static template to start, and opt-in to shipping JS as needed with our [partial hydration helpers](/docs/partial-hydration).
- 💅 **Bundles all your resources** with the power of Vite. Use your favorite CSS preprocessor, JS minifier, and more with minimal config.

## Technologies used

Slinkity stands on the shoulders of giants. You can think of Slinkity as the "glue" binding 2 tools together:

1. [**Eleventy:**](https://www.11ty.dev) a static site generator with a rich feature set for fetching data, composing layouts, and inserting content with "shortcodes."
2. [**Vite:**](https://vitejs.dev) a bundler that takes the boilerplate out of your set up. It'll compile JS component frameworks, handle CSS preprocessors with little-to-no config (say, SCSS and PostCSS), and show dev changes on-the-fly using [hot module replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

## Getting started

Use our handy CLI command to spin up a Slinkity site: `npm init slinkity`. This demos our core functionality while staying as lean as possible, making it the perfect launchpad for new projects 🚀

## Feature set

This project is still in early alpha, so we have many features soon to come! [This demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zp6CodHjc&t=493s) covers a majority of features we support today. For reference, here's our complete roadmap of current and upcoming features:

| Feature                                                | Status |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| CLI to run 11ty and Vite simultaneously                | ✅      |
| React component pages & layouts                        | ✅      |
| React component shortcodes                             | ✅      |
| SCSS and SASS                                          | ✅      |
| PostCSS config (ex. Tailwind)                          | ✅      |
| CSS imports via ESM (including CSS modules) *          | ⏺      |
| Plugin ecosystem for your favorite component framework |
| (Vue, Svelte, Solid, etc)                              | ⏳      |
| Eleventy serverless compatibility                      | ❌      |
| Shared state between component shortcodes              | ❌      |
| Styled components & Emotion                            | ❌      |

_*CSS imports will work today, but with one caveat: stylesheets will bleed to other routes on your site. We're actively working on a fix!_

- ✅ = Ready to use
- ⏺ = Partial support
- ⏳ = In progress
- ❌ = Not started, but on roadmap
